# memotest-game

This is a memory game I coded as an assignment for Ada's institute. It's built using HTML5, SCSS and JQuery using a given layout for the design concept.

It displays a ranking of the players that won (using the Local Storage) once the game is finished.
It has 3 levels defined by the number of attempts the player has until they find all the matches.
The images behind each card shuffle dinamically everytime the game begins.
