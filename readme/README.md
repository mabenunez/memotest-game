# memotest-game
This is a memory game I coded as an assignment for Ada's institute. 
It's built using HTML5, SCSS and JQuery using a given layout for the design concept.

- It displays a ranking of the players that won (using the Local Storage) once the game is finished.
- It has 3 levels defined by the number of attempts the player has until they find all the matches.
- The images behind each card shuffle dinamically everytime the game begins.
